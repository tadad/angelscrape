So, I leveraged my background in engineering, chemistry, and art to develop Spero's patent-pending formulations and brand.\r\n \r\nAt Spero, we make dairy from seeds. \r\n \r\nWhy seeds? Almonds/cashews (nuts), which comprise the majority of the dairy alternatives industry today, will never create cost comparable products with dairy because they are too expensive and they're hard to scale. They take too much time, space, water, and human labor. Seeds are 7-8x less expensive and grow 50-70x faster than nuts.\r\n \r\nSpero owns exclusive rights to the technology needed to transform seeds into dairy alternatives. Not only does our pending-patent cover novel processing techniques for cheeses, but it\u2019s comprehensive for all dairy alternatives, including milk, creamers, yogurt, and even eggs.\r\n \r\nBy using truly scalable ingredients and cutting-edge technology, Spero will be the first company to make plant-based dairy cheaper than traditional dairy products.

Vapes provide a cumbersome, over-the-top experience \u2014 with use as tightly restricted as cigarette smoking itself, but more juvenile, conspicuous, and highly addictive. People want, and deserve, a better way.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we want to deliver nicotine users a superior experience, and at the same time give them a way to transition out of feeling dependent. In a better society, people wouldn\u2019t carry around the sensation that they\u2019re stuck with an involuntary habit.

In a recent study conducted by leading cancer researchers in Europe and Asia on 900 patients with a variety of late-stage cancers, Oncobox increased the effectiveness of targeted therapies from 25% to 64%.\n\nHow does Oncobox work? Over 150 targeted cancer drugs are currently on the market. But deciding which of these drugs to give to late-stage cancer patients is not a simple task. Cancer doctors are in a race against the clock, they don\u2019t always know which drug will be most effective for their patients, and because these drugs are expensive and typically have significant side effects, they can\u2019t just try them all. Because of these barriers, targeted cancer therapies are effective only 25% of the time, and 70% of patients with late-stage cancers die due to the toxic side effects of ineffective drugs.\n\nAt an estimated cost of $2,000 per patient, the Oncobox Integral Test analyzes DNA and RNA of over 2000 genes that are included in major molecular pathways using algorithms to distinguish which molecular targets are the most crucial for individual cases and finds the right drug for them. Doctors receive a clinically actionable report that shows them which drugs are likely to be most effective on the patient.\n\nWe are actively seeking partners from pharma, hospitals/clinicians, payers, and genomic centers.

Opening of 100K new fuel stations is practically & economically impossible in urban localities due to rocketing high land prices. And that's how the idea of mobile refueling was conceptualized by founders. Literally \"bringing the gas stations to doorsteps\". The problem of buying fuel is much more alarming in large volume consumer segments such as Vehicle fleet users like schools, cab rentals, freight logistics operators , tours and travels operators, hospitals, hotels, real estate etc who burn huge amount of dead mileage & loss of productivity while sending all fleet vehicles to gas stations to fill up. Additionally, India has a unique problem of Electricity blackouts. Current avg. is less than 18 hours of a day of electricity in Indian metro cities, which causes more than 20 mln household and commercial buildings running on backup generators which require Diesel. They cant bring the generators to gas stations either therefore they buy Diesel in jerry cans or barrels and transport unsafely.

Our first product is a small molecule therapeutic for stimulants like cocaine and methamphetamine, of which there are no FDA approved treatments.\r\n\r\nOur small molecule technology are atypical inhibitors of the dopamine transporter. Cocaine itself is an inhibitor of the same transporter. Directly reducing craving or positive reinforcement is a successful treatment strategy for addiction. Methadone or buprenorphine (Suboxone) are key examples of this for opioid use disorder. However, these types of medications can be addictive themselves. This has been a major hurdle for medication development for cocaine addiction and has led to many leaders in the addiction space to abandon the dopamine transporter as a target. At EncepHeal, we believe that the dopamine transporter should not be abandoned and instead focusing on fixing the abuse liability problem. Therefore with our partners at the National Institutes of Health, we have shown that these new, allosteric modulators at the dopamine transporter do not display addictive tendencies in animal models. They are also effective at curbing cocaine addiction. \r\n\r\nOur management team has two co-founders, Omeed Rahimi and Aaron Lazarus, as well as an experienced addiction pharmacologist as their research officer. The team has an advisory board with entrepreneurial and addiction drug development experience as well as expert partners at the National Institute on Drug Abuse, a subset of the NIH, and Wake Forest.\r\n\r\nOur team has had success in raising non-dilutive funding and has expertise with SBIR/STTR grants.

In much of Sub-Saharan Africa, people make payments using mobile money, an electronic wallet service that is typically tied to a user's cell phone carrier and sim card. Using a 39-46 digit sequence of short codes (i.e. dialing a code such as 150*30*1331, waiting for a screen to pop-up, dialing another code and waiting for that screen, repeat, etc.) that are received by the user's cell phone carrier, a user can request to send money to a friend, pay a bill, or purchase airtime all without being connected to the internet and accessible via smartphone and basic feature phone alike. (M-Pesa, which you may have heard of, is just one of the many such mobile money services offered in Sub-Saharan Africa).\r\n\r\nWhile mobile money has undoubtedly transformed the way that millions of people transact, the process of executing a mobile money payment is time-consuming, arduous, and prone to error, resulting in a less than ideal transactor experience. After moving back to my home country of Tanzania in 2017 and conducting 700+ on-the-ground interviews, Sam and I founded NALA, the first internet-free mobile money smartphone application. NALA interfaces with existing mobile money providers (M-Pesa, Airtel, tiGO etc.), and provides users with a simple Venmo-like payment experience. To deliver this capability, NALA has built a USSD automator tool to send requests over existing USSD channels.\r\n\r\nOur product serves as a central platform where users can initialize payments for all of their mobile money accounts (having multiple sim cards and mobile money accounts is extremely common in Sub-Saharan Africa as inter-network transaction fees are lower than out-of-network fees), and for the first time ever, access their transaction histories through our rich transaction tool. While we will make a percentage cut for every bill payment and airtime top-up that is conducted on our platform, we are primarily focused on growing our active user-base.\r\n\r\nAs Sub-Saharan Africa mobile money usage proliferates ($860+ million in daily transaction values and close to 400 million mobile money accounts), smartphone penetration approaches 40%, and the fastest growing middle class of any continent comes into its own, we believe there is massive potential to transform and shape the African payment space. Building a product that thoughtfully addresses our users' financial challenges is what excites and energizes us. The pernicious transaction fees that mobile money users are subject to is an area of particular interest and focus.\r\n\r\nWe would love to hear about YC ideas and experiences in this space, feel free to ping by email: founders@nala.money", "website": "https://www.nala.money", "year_founded": null, "team_size": 10, "location": "Dar es Salaam, Tanzania", "original_pull": "2020-08-04", "relevant": true, "dead": false}, {"name": "Mudrex", "description": "Mudrex is on a mission to bring risk optimised high yield investments to everyone.\r\n\r\nSophisticated high yield investments like hedge funds have been accessible only to richest.

Play inspires and scaffolds the creative process from an early age, but there is a persistent gap between the origins of imaginative play (ages 4-5) and kids' adoption of the formal discipline of creative writing (ages 8-10).\n\nAt Launchpad Toys, we're using mobile devices like the iPad to bridge this gap between informal and formal learning, to harness the power of play to help children capture and share their ideas with other kids around the world. Our first product, Toontastic an app for the iPad, is a creative learning tool that blends constructionist and social development theories to empower young children to create, learn, and share their ideas through play.", "website": "http://launchpadtoys.com", "year_founded": null, "team_size": 2, "location": "San Francisco", "original_pull": "2020-08-04", "relevant": false, "dead": false}, {"name": "SendHub", "description": "SendHub makes business communication fast, simple, and effective.
