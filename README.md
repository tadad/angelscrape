# angelscrape
This was my first attempt at making a tool that would identify seed stage investments. The website is functional, but the approach for gathering data was incorrect.
I built a ton of scripts to crawl particular sites like YC and other interesting angel/seed investors. However, this data ended up being super out of date and useless most of the time.
Eventually I pivoted to using Twitter as the primary data source instead of websites. Twitter is very up to date, and angel investors are pretty explicit about who they are inveting in
when it comes to what Tweets they "like" and when they follow new people. There are a number of things I would have improved as far as the coding goes, but it was my first webapp so I'll
let some of the grossness slide.
